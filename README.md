# ToDo_List

This is a Todo List Website where you can:
1. Add Task: We can add as many as we want to be completed by us.                             
2. Delete Task: If you have added a wrong task you can delete that task anytime.                
3. Mark as Complete: It also helps us to mark the task that we have already completed from the list of tasks.                                
4. Save the Task: It also saves your task for your future reference. ie: Even when you close your browser or refresh your browser the list of tasks that you have added in your list will remain.
